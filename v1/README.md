# OriginVault Namespaces - v1

Welcome to the `v1` namespace of OriginVault. This namespace defines the initial version of the DID Method Specification for the OriginVault ecosystem, enabling decentralized identifiers (DIDs) for robust and secure interactions.

## Overview

The `v1` namespace is the foundation for OriginVault's DID implementation. It provides detailed specifications and guidelines for creating and interacting with DIDs, ensuring interoperability, security, and compliance with decentralized standards.

## Key Features

- **Decentralized Identifier (DID) Method Specification**:
  - Detailed documentation on how DIDs are created, resolved, and updated in the OriginVault ecosystem.
  - Support for both traditional and quantum-safe cryptographic mechanisms.
- **Interoperability**:
  - Built to align with W3C DID standards, ensuring compatibility with other DID implementations.
- **Security**:
  - Emphasizes secure key management and cryptographic practices.

## Documentation

The full DID Method Specification for this version is available here:
- [DID Method Specification](./did_method_specification.md)

## Usage

1. **Creating a DID**:
   Follow the steps outlined in the [DID Method Specification](./did_method_specification.md) to generate a new DID.

2. **Resolving a DID**:
   Use the resolution process described to retrieve DID documents securely.

3. **Updating a DID**:
   Learn how to securely update DIDs in compliance with the `v1` specification.
